## Digital Wildcatters Case Study – Will Atwater
## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: 
Digital Wildcatters
* When was the company incorporated?
2018

* Who are the founders of the company?
Collin McLelland, Jacob Corley, Julie McLelland


* Digital Wildcatters was originally only content creation, with the founders sharing their experiences purchasing, developing, and operating oil wells. The company grew into a networking organization, and the founders realized that too much technical knowledge and lessons learned were being lost in the Great Crew Change as older experienced oil industry workers retired. 
As the founders developed a knowledge sharing platform, they realized that incorporating AI would make the platform much more powerful and effective. In addition to AI and networking services, Digital Wildcatters produces several podcasts. 

* Digital Wildcatters has raised $7 million from angel investors and public energy industry companies. They are currently raising $10 million from venture capital investors. 

## Business Activities

* Digital Wildcatters seeks to capture and organize technical knowledge, lessons learned, and SME networks in the oil and gas industry and make it all available and accessible to energy professionals.  

* The company’s intended customers are energy industry companies and professionals. The conventional energy industry is a $2 trillion a year capex market, Digital Wildcatters is targeting potential revenue of $1 billion.

* Digital Wildcatters offers fully built out retrieval augmented generation models backed by energy specific databases, such as white papers and technical manuals that are not widely available to the public.

* Digital Wildcatters currently uses RAG vector and Qdrant databases, sometimes built within Microsoft azure. Their LLMs use GPT and Llama, Ruby on Rails frontend and backend, Jumpstart rails, and Python scripting.

## Landscape

* Digital Wildcatters is primarily in the conventional energy field, but also is breaking into unconventional energy. They are also in the technology and networking fields.

* Major recent trends in the energy industry involve a big shift in digital technology, especially since the oil and gas industry was 15 years behind in this area. From a workforce perspective, millennials are taking over senior positions due to the Great Crew Change (retirement of older workers).

* There aren’t any companied like Digital Wildcatters specifically targeting the oil and gas industry market. Perplexity is the leader in RAG technology.

## Results

* Digital Wildcatters is providing leading generative AI to energy companies, saving 39% of engineers' time.

* User growth is a core metric for Digital Wildcatters, which has been 20% month over month. Digital Wildcatters has users in 95 countries. The company also focuses on revenue growth. They are close to achieving 7 figures of revenue from AI products. Their tools are deployed in 3 companies, soon to be 5.

* Digital Wildcatters has no significant competitors. In our interview, co-founder Collin McLelland stated, “we are f--king crushing them”.

## Recommendations


* I suggest that Digital Wildcatters develop data entry automation programs for oil and gas field operations. 

* Oil companies, even supermajors, use archaic methods and programs for data entry in the field. It’s flawed, it’s expensive, and it’s a waste of highly paid operations managers’ time.

* Automated data entry programs would require fine tuning LLM models to be appropriate for the specific area and company. 

* Operations are standardized very differently by different companies in different areas of the world.
