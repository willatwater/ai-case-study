* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Digital Wildcatters was originally only content creation, with the founders sharing their experiences purchasing, developing, and operating oil wells. The company grew into a networking organization, and the founders realized that too much technical knowledge and lessons learned were being lost in the Great Crew Change as older experienced oil industry workers retired. 
As the founders developed a knowledge sharing platform, they realized that incorporating AI would make the platform much more powerful and effective. In addition to AI and networking services, Digital Wildcatters produces several podcasts.

Major recent trends in the energy industry involve a big shift in digital technology, especially since the oil and gas industry was 15 years behind in this area. From a workforce perspective, millennials are taking over senior positions due to the Great Crew Change (retirement of older workers).

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
I would suggest data entry automation programs for oil and gas field operations. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Oil companies, even supermajors, use archaic methods and programs for data entry in the field. It’s flawed, it’s expensive, and it’s a waste of highly paid operations managers’ time.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Automated data entry programs would require fine tuning LLM models to be appropriate for the specific area and company. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Operations are standardized very differently by different companies in different areas of the world.
